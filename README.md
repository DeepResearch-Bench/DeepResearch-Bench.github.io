# DeepResearch Bench

This is the source code repository for the [DeepResearch Bench](https://deepresearch-bench.github.io) project website.

## Project Overview

DeepResearch Bench is a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating Deep Research Agents (DRAs). It consists of 100 PhD-level research tasks meticulously crafted by domain experts across 22 distinct fields.

The benchmark evaluates the capabilities of deep research agents through two innovative assessment methodologies:
- **RACE** (Reference-based Adaptive Criteria-driven Evaluation framework with Dynamic Weighting): for evaluating the quality of generated research reports
- **FACT** (Framework for Factual Abundance and Citation Trustworthiness): for assessing information retrieval effectiveness and citation accuracy
